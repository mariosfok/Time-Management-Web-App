# Time Management Web App

This is a small and simple project designed to help me manage my study time at university. It's a basic countdown timer that allows me to set a specific time for focused study sessions. The app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to assist with time management during my university studies. It helps me keep track of study periods and ensures that I stay focused and productive.

## Features

- **Timer Functionality**: Set a timer to focus on study sessions.
- **Simple UI**: The interface is easy to use with a clean design.
- **Progress: Tracks your daily study sessions in minutes by day.
- **Customization**: The site is tailored to fit the specific needs of me and my friends, making it a useful tool for our study sessions.

## Future Improvements

I plan to expand the app in the future, possibly adding more features, such as notifications, a task manager, or a way to track completed sessions.
